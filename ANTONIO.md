# Tower Defense MVP Report

## Current Progress
- Implemented towers: Tesla, Mortar, Catapult
- Map designer/editor with basic functional test maps
- Core UI: life bar and money bar
- Linear tower upgrades

## Missing Elements for a Minimal Release

### Narrative Context
A short story framing the conflict helps players engage. Suggested hook:
> In a stark monochrome future, neon power cores fuel the last safe city. Rogue machines march to seize them, and the player must deploy experimental defenses to keep the grid alive.

### Gameplay & Content
- Create 10 playable levels and decide whether they serve as tutorial, campaign, or both
- Expand towers with 2–3 branch upgrade trees for strategic variety
- Include at least one support tower (e.g. slow field or buff tower) to complement offensive types

### Interface & UX
- Replace the debug tower UI with polished buttons and tooltips
- Add a pre-game menu for map selection, settings, and quitting
- Implement an in-game pause menu with resume/restart/exit options
- Provide short tutorial prompts or an intro level to teach basics

### Audio & Feedback
- Basic sound effects for towers firing, enemies dying, and UI clicks
- Minimal background track with volume control

### Quality-of-Life
- Save progress/unlocked levels locally
- Display victory/defeat screens with stats

## Suggestions to Reduce CEO Workload
- Team drafts narrative and tower concepts; CEO only reviews/approves
- Use the existing map editor to build campaign levels—no extra tools
- Keep monetization simple at launch (single purchase). Evaluate DLC after release metrics
